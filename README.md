# cop-3710-Crime_Stats_Database
Project Scope:
Designing a database to track homicides and create a hotspot ranking and 
track trends based on factors such as: age, race, sex, location, agency that made arrest, 
state, year, month, type of crime, ethnicity of victims and perpetrators 
and also the relationship between victim and perpetrator and murder weapon

Users:
In this theoretical scenario users would be members of law enforcement who can track and analyze crimes based on patterns.
Such as with copycat killers or killers who belong to similar groups (Extreme groups)

Data Sources:
Dataset used is a collection of homicide reports from 1980-204 compiled by the Murder accountability project
